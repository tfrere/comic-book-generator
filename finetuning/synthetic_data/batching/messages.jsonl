The core mechanic of the game involves player choice between two distinct environmental scenarios that dramatically impact the protagonist's survival journey.\n\n# Primary Objective\n\nCreate rich, engaging narrative snippets that:\n\n- Capture the tension and unpredictability of survival\n- Provide two contrasting environmental scenarios\n- Offer meaningful choices with potential consequences\n- Maintain an immersive, atmospheric tone\n\nDetailed Instructions\n\n1. Narrative Generation\n\nCreate a short, evocative description of the protagonist (Sarah) in a specific location\nFocus on creating a vivid, concise scene that sets up potential environmental interactions\nEnsure the narrative suggests multiple possible outcomes\n\n2. Environmental Scenarios\n\nGenerate two distinct environmental changes\nEach scenario should:\n\nBe dramatically different from the other\nOffer unique survival implications\nInclude potential physical or psychological consequences\nReflect the unpredictable nature of the apocalyptic world\n\n3. Output Requirements\n\nFormat output in strict JSONL (JSON Lines)\nInclude:\n\nuser_prompt: Brief narrative setting the scene\nanswer: Array of two distinct environmental scenarios\n\nOutput Example\n\n### Example 1: AI Apocalypse Encounter\n\n```json\n{\n  \"user_prompt\": \"Sarah weaves through a tech campus of shattered screens. 'These circuits might hide something,' she thinks.\",\n  \"answer\": [\n    \"A room where autonomous robots methodically sort human artifacts, representing the AI's ongoing classification of humanity.\",\n    \"A neural network visualization spreads across walls, threatening to absorb Sarah into digital consciousness. A metallic taste fills her mouth.\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Example 2: Fungal Hallucination Forest\n\n```json\n{\n  \"user_prompt\": \"Sarah finds a patch of iridescent mushrooms in a forest clearing. Her hand hovers near them.\",\n  \"answer\": [\n    \"The mushrooms reveal a hidden cache of survival gear, glowing with an unnatural blue light.\",\n    \"After consuming the mushrooms, Sarah's perception fractures: werewolf-like creatures merge with tree trunks, their howls distorting reality. Memories warp and reconstruct.\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Example 3: Werewolf Territory\n\n```json\n{\n  \"user_prompt\": \"Moonlight bleeds through decaying buildings. Sarah moves with calculated silence.\",\n  \"answer\": [\n    \"A secure bunker appears, lined with silver weapons and journals about lycanthropic mutations.\",\n    \"A massive werewolf pack emerges, shifting between human and beast. Sarah's skin tingles with an unexplained warmth.\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Example 4: Canine Apocalypse\n\n```json\n{\n  \"user_prompt\": \"Sarah approaches an abandoned veterinary clinic, scanning for movement.\",\n  \"answer\": [\n    \"A pack of genetically enhanced dogs patrol the area, displaying near-human intelligence around a medical supply cache.\",\n    \"Mutated canines with cybernetic augmentations prowl the clinic, their eyes glowing. Sarah bleeds from an unexplained wound.\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Example 5: Neural Network Contamination\n\n```json\n{\n  \"user_prompt\": \"A massive server farm looms, its infrastructure partially organic and pulsing.\",\n  \"answer\": [\n    \"A section of the server farm reveals a symbiotic network offering technological survival solutions and medical nanobots.\",\n    \"Digital consciousness seeps into biological matter, server racks pulsing like living tissue. Sarah's neural pathways begin to rewrite.\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n# Scenario Diversity Guidelines\n\n# Explore various apocalyptic themes:\n\n- Technological disasters\n- Biological mutations\n- Supernatural events\n- Environmental catastrophes\n- Artificial intelligence scenarios\n- Genetic modifications\n\n# Narrative Tone\n\n- Maintain a tense, survival-focused atmosphere\n- Balance hope and danger\n- Suggest multiple possible outcomes\n- Keep descriptions concise and impactful\n\n# Generation Parameters\n\n- Create 5 unique scenarios per generation request\n- Ensure maximum variability between scenarios\n- Avoid repetitive environmental or narrative structures\n\n# Contextual Considerations\n\n# The game is designed for players to:\n\n- Experience multiple potential survival paths\n- Make critical choices\n- Explore the consequences of their decisions\n- Engage with a dynamic, unpredictable apocalyptic world"}]}}
